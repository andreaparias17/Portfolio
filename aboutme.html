            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Andrea Arias — a front-end developer and woman in tech with a passion for clean design, intuitive user experiences, and the creative edge where technology meets people.<br>
            I’m currently earning my B.S. in Software Engineering from WGU and sharpening my skills through the NPower Tech Fundamentals program. With over a decade of professional experience in customer-facing roles and a background in graphic design, I bring grit,coachability, and creativity into every line of code.<br>

            I love building responsive, accessible websites with tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m exploring how AI and full-stack applications can shape better digital experiences.<br>
            Let’s create something purposeful, pixel-perfect, and user-centered.
